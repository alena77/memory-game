## How to play

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Known Bugs

Firefox browser sometimes loses sound wav files inside <audio> tag. Restarting browser fixes problem.

If 4 cards are selected in quick succession, javascript functionality breacks. (Explode function stops at shake stage and does not finish)
